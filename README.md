WonderLust
Project Duration: October 2023 â€“ December 2023

WonderLust is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to provide users with a platform to list their properties or hotels for rent. The application offers a seamless experience for both property owners and renters, ensuring efficient property management and exploration.

Key Features
Full-Stack Development
The application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Node.js and Express.js were utilized for the back-end, creating a robust server framework to handle client requests and server responses efficiently.
Database Management
MongoDB was integrated for database management, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. This NoSQL database was chosen for its flexibility and scalability, accommodating diverse property attributes and user data.
CRUD Functionality
